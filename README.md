| ðŸš² [divvy-trips](https://www.kaggle.com/code/martinruchtein/how-does-a-bike-share-navigate-speedy-success) | May 2025 | R, Kaggle, RStudio | A marketing-focused analysis conducted as part of the Google Data Analytics course. Using RStudio, I explored usage patterns between casual riders and annual members of Cyclistic, a Chicago-based bike-share company. The goal was to generate data-driven insights and visualizations to support strategies aimed at converting casual users into long-term members. |
